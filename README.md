<i>Future-proof woocommerce checkout plugin for startups and growing businesses</i>
<br/><br/>
‚ÄúGetting ganked by one payment processor for excessive risk/chargebacks and struggling to switch to another is guaranteed to get you some real quick business lessons.‚Äù

**Problem: Woocommerce plugins which solve for checkout experience are not really payment processor agnostic**

If your payouts are blocked by the payment processor, your business comes to a standstill. You do not have an alternative option to ensure business continuity. 

And, of course there are some Woocommerce plugins which solve the above problem, but they are not PCI compliant to store credit card data. So, your customers‚Äô credit cards are tokenized and stored with a single payment processor!!

- **Embedded checkout experience** across 40+ processors and 80+ payment methods 
- **PCI Compliant** to store credit/debit card data
- **Smart routing engine** to define business rules to optimize your payment cost and boost conversion rates.
- **Single unified dashboard** for analytics and refunds
- **Automatic retries** to enhance conversion rate
- **Local payment methods** for your customers to pay
- **Native payment experience** for a better payment experience
- **SDK Integrations** to support your business when it grows
- **Fraud and risk management** to reduce chargebacks

And it is absolutely **free** for upto 3,000 transactions per month !!!

**Customize your Payment Experience**
This plugin is built to seamlessly tailor the payment experience to match your website‚Äôs branding by blending the payment sheet into your WordPress theme. If you wish to, you can further customize the ‚ÄúAppearance‚Äù and ‚ÄúLayout‚Äù of the payment sheet using styles or pre-built themes.

**Pay Now**
Accept full payments at checkout with multiple payment methods, such as credit/debit card, wallets or pay-later.

**Manual Capture**
You can choose to capture customer payments automatically or manually, as per your needs. Once a customer authorizes their payment, you can easily capture payments manually through the Woocommerce Dashboard.

**Refunds**
In cases where you need to issue a refund to a customer, the Hyperswitch plugin streamlines this process within your Woocommerce Dashboard.

**Sync Payments**
With the Hyperswitch plugin integrated into your Woocommerce Dashboard, you have the flexibility to manually sync payment status whenever necessary. This feature allows you to ensure accurate payment status representation and maintain consistent order management.

**Real-time Order Updates**
Hyperswitch facilitates seamless order updates through webhooks, allowing you to automate various order management processes. By setting up webhooks within your Hyperswitch Plugin Settings and configuring the necessary endpoints in your Hyperswitch Dashboard, you can receive real-time notifications about order status changes, payment confirmations, and more.

**PCI compliant**
The Hyperswitch plugin comes with PCI compliance. So your customer‚Äôs cards are secured in a private card vault and not stored/tokenized with any payment processor. If and when you decide to move out of WooCommerce, you carry your cards on file and recurring payment tokens with you.

**Smart Routing Engine**
Hyperswitch‚Äôs powerful routing engine gives the flexibility to route the transactions between processors to increase their conversion rate, decrease cost or any other business logic. 

**Unified Dashboard**
From a single unified dashboard, merchants can view their transaction analytics, complete refunds, manage subscriptions, understand the customer journey on their store and much more.

**Automatic Retries**
When a transaction fails via one processor, Hyperswitch automatically tries to salvage it by routing it through another processor, whenever possible. This happens intelligently without your customer even knowing it happened in the background.

**Local Payment Methods**
Enabling local payment methods, alternative payment methods for your ever-growing customer base cannot be easier. You just need to tick a checkbox on the hyperswitch control center and the payment method shows up for your customers in the relevant geographies, without any additional effort at your end. Historically, diverse local payment methods have been known to boost conversion rates for the merchants.

**Native Payment Experience**
We strive to enhance the payment experience for our customers. Be it avoiding redirections and promoting native payment experience, to supporting embedded payments, Hyperswitch continuously tries to improve the payment experience for the customers and ensures uplift in the conversion rates for the merchants.

**SDK integrations**
Most of the Woocommerce payment plugins will support a merchant only on Woocommerce. Hyperswitch has native SDKs, hosted checkout and api-integrations for merchants who want to build their own apps, for both web and mobile. 

**Fraud and Risk Management**
Hyperswitch is integrated with leading third party fraud and risk management platforms like Signifyd, Riskified, etc. If you are burdened with increasing frauds and chargebacks, Hyperswitch can help you reduce frauds and chargebacks.

### ü§ù Our Belief

> Payments should be open, fast, reliable and affordable to serve
> the billions of people at scale.

Globally payment diversity has been growing at a rapid pace.
There are hundreds of payment processors and new payment methods like BNPL,
RTP etc.
Businesses need to embrace this diversity to increase conversion, reduce cost
and improve control.
But integrating and maintaining multiple processors needs a lot of dev effort.
Why should devs across companies repeat the same work?
Why can't it be unified and reused? Hence, Hyperswitch was born to create that
reusable core and let companies build and customise it as per their specific requirements.

### ‚ú® Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximise Value Creation: For developers, customers & partners.
